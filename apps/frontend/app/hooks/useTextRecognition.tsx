 * what buys this feature its independence from a native build: no new module,
 * no new binary, ships as an OTA update. The engine itself is unpacked out of
 * the app onto the device, so it works offline and tells no one about it.
 *
 * Taking a picture and reading it are kept strictly apart. The camera is the
 * platform's own (`expo-camera`) and has nothing to do with this file; what
 * arrives here is a finished image. And the WebView only ever exists while the
 * camera preview does not: on Android both want a hardware surface, and a
 * screen holding both shows an empty preview and then takes the app down. The
 * caller says which of the two it is showing through `isCameraActive`.
 *
 * The caller must render `engineElement`; without it there is no WebView and
 * `recognizeImage` never resolves.
