 * web build serves it from the app's own origin; native copies it onto the
 * device and points a hidden WebView at it (`useTextRecognition.tsx`). Two
 * things follow from that, and both are on purpose:
 *
 * - **Nothing is fetched from a CDN.** The engine ships with the app (see
 *   `public/tesseract/README.md`) and works offline. A photographed bank card
 *   is not something to hand a third party, and neither is the fact that
 *   someone is about to scan one.
 * - **No native module.** React Native has no WebAssembly, a WebView has it, so
 *   the feature needs no new binary and ships as an OTA update.
